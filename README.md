- **LSP Support**: Pre-configured with `nvim-lspconfig` and related plugins for language server integration, autocompletion, and code actions.
- **UI Enhancements**: Includes statusline, bufferline, file explorer, dashboard, and more for a modern look and feel.
- **Productivity Tools**: Integrated fuzzy finder, git integration, session management, and multi-cursor editing.
